# Design Portfolio
   
``` Hi, my name is Sylvia Lin. ```
I am a junior student majoring in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Insitute. I am interested in studying topics related to design, data science, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This is a website I created in dedication to the HCI class I took in B term 2018.

## Project Overview

- ### Project 1 - **Design for Others**
Using _Invision_, our group of three created a mobile application prototype of the website Worcester Public Library for small kids in hope to make the navigation process easier and more fun.

- ### Project 2 - **Design for Understanding**
Our group of four worked in pairs and designed multiple charts using _Vega_ about suicide attacks. By using multiple types of charts which were then combined with an interactive interface, we conveyed the destructiveness of improvised explosive devices.

To better help students find their true career passions, our group of four achieved two entirely different ways of utilizing the features of facial recognition (_Affectiva SDK_) with website development (_CSS_, _HTML_, and _Javascript_).

- ### Project 5 - **Design for Another World**
In this four-people project, we established a VR model of a teahouse on _A-Frame_. We manipulated colors and lines to bring people into a surreal space where there is no clear boundary between reality and virtuality.
