# Design Portfolio
>     
> Hi, my name is Sylvia Lin. I am a junior student studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Insitute. I am interested in topics related to design, data science, and Human-Computer Interaction. This is a website I created in dedication to the Human-Computer Interaction class I took in B term 2018.
