# Design Portfolio

Hi, my name is Sylvia Lin. I am a junior student studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Insitute. 
I am interested in topics related to design, data science, and Human-Computer Interaction.
This is a website I created dedicated to the Human-Computer Interaction class I took in B term 2018.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/eos7l/CS3041/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
